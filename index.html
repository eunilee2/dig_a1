			<h2>Dataset: Fatal Accidental Overdoses in Allegheny County 2007 - 2025</h2>
			<p>
				This dataset contains 7,478 entries of fatal accidental overdose cases in the Allegheny County region of Pennsylvania. 
				It only includes cases from 2007 to 2025 that have been closed, meaning that a final conclusion about the case is made 
				after following all steps of the procedure in administering the case investigation. Each case contains three types of 
				information: 1. the geotemporal data of each case that covers the death date and time, case year, and incident zip, 
				2. demographic data that includes the case subject's age, sex, and race, and 3. the polysubstance data that covers 
				the types of drugs used and the number of drugs used in each overdose case. One thing to note about this data is that 
				incident zip indicates the zip code of where the Office of the Medical Examiner received the body, not necessarily where 
				the overdose occurred. Nevertheless, as we explore the dataset, I hope to uncover more detail in understanding emerging 
				temporal trends in drug cases and quantitative trends in the polysubstance nature of cases. Understanding this can allow 
				us to compare overdose deaths on a year-by-year basis and potentially how current policies and interventions might play 
				a role in these results. <br><br>
				This data can be found online at:

			<h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>
			<p>
				To determine the current state of the dataset, we will first understand the distribution of the data respective to the temporal, 
				spatial, and categorical features that our analysis questions. By doing these basic statistical analysis, we are then able to 
				minimize the bias in our assumptions and follow-up questions that will explore our overall questions further. 
			</p>

			</figure>
			<p>
				We first look at our dataset using a univariate analysis. By mapping the aggregate fatal 
				overdose cases by each year between 2007 and 2025, we can make several observations. The 
				first observation is that there is an overall increase in the number of overdose cases 
				from the years 2007-2023. During those years, there was a remarkably large number of 
				cases in 2016 and 2017. <br><br>
				By looking further into reports about this sharp increase in opioid deaths, we find that 
				there is no conclusive reason for why the number of cases had jumped drastically. We can, 
				however, attribute the decline of deaths post 2017 to the widespread distribution efforts 
				of the anti-overdose drug naloxone in which the county Health Department 
				<a href="https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/officials-allegheny-county-overdose-deaths-dropped-significantly-last-year/#:~:text=Williams%20credited%20the%20availability%20of,deaths%20about%20a%20decade%20ago.">distributed more 
				than 8000 kits.</a><br><br>
				Considering these observations and the low number of cases for 2025 (which we can attribute 
				to the fact that cases may not be filed in just yet), following analyses will look at the 
				years 2007-2024 with special emphasis on the years 2016-2017 in hopes to uncover the unknown 
				causes for the sharp increase in deaths.

			<p>
				We next turn to analyzing fatal overdose cases by day of the week. This perspective highlights 
				how overdoses align with the rhythms of daily life rather than long-term trends. We find that 
				the lowest number of cases occur on Mondays, with counts gradually increasing throughout the 
				week and peaking on weekends, particularly on Saturday. <br><br>
				This weekly pattern suggests that social and recreational behaviors, stress cycles, or 
				availability of substances may play a role in shaping risk across the week. While these 
				observations cannot fully explain the causes of overdoses, they provide important context for how 
				everyday temporal patterns contribute to the broader annual trends identified earlier.
			</p>

				<figcaption>
				Number of fatal overdose cases by month, colored by season.

			</figure>
			<p>
				Analyzing fatal overdoses by month reveals a seasonal pattern: cases tend to peak in the spring 
				months, with April standing out at 689 cases, while winter and fall months report some of the lowest counts. 
				December breaks this trend, with cases rising again, possibly reflecting holiday-related stress or gatherings.
				<br><br>
				These patterns suggest that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36843423/"> seasonal factors such as 
				environmental stressors and social behaviors may shape overdose risk</a>, warranting further exploration. 
				Following analyses will compare these seasonal cycles with other temporal factors, such as demographics 
				and geographic distribution, to better understand how context influences overdose deaths."

			</figure>
			<p>
				Now that we have a temporal understanding of the dataset, we also will take a look at the spatial 
				context of the dataset. Using a simple bar graph in which we transformed our dataset to exclude 
				2025 (as the year is not done yet and cases are not fully filed), we are able to see the top 10 zip 
				codes where the highest number of overdose cases have been filed. While we note that the dataset 
				describes the incident zip codes in this dataset as not actually equating to where the overdose has 
				taken place (rather, the incident zip code is the zip code where the Office of the Medical Examiner 
				has received the body), we can assume that the incident zip code is handled at the site or nearby 
				the vicinity of the overdose death following the 
				<a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Government/Police-and-Emergency-Services/Medical-Examiner-ACOME/Death-Investigations#:~:text=The%20pathologist%20decides%20whether%20an,Statistics%20via%20the%20Funeral%20Director.">
					protocols that the Office must follow. 
				</a>
				<br><br>
				One thing to note is that there is a non-trival number (n=224) of cases where the incident zip code 
				is unknown. Considering that 224 cases is only 3% of the total 7,478 cases in our dataset, it would 
				not severely affect our overall dataset if we were to remove these cases in the following visualizations. 
				To address this data quality issue, for the following visualizations that showcase our data on a map, 
				we will remove these extraneous cases that are outside of our scope (null values or outside of Allegheny 
				County) within a reasonable percentage of our overall dataset. 
			</p>

			</figure>
			<p>
				Addressing the data quality issue prior, we find that we actually have 6.6% of our dataset affected when 
				mapping our cases spatially on maps as seen above. This 6.6% accounts for the 224 cases of null/unknown 
				zip code cases and also the 273 cases of extraneous zip codes that fall outside of Allegheny County, 
				bringing a total of 497 cases that are excluded in the dataset we are currently examining for our spatial 
				analysis. Just like prior, we will continue to use this processed dataset when continuing with the remainder 
				of our exploratory visualizations given the scope of our questions and also the small percentage of overall 
				cases these malformed/out of scope cases take up. <br><br>
				Regarding the actual results of our choropleth above, which maps the aggregate count of cases over each zip 
				code in Allegheny County, we find that high counts of overdose cases are mainly centered at or nearby the 
				metropolitan area of the county in Pittsburgh. In fact, the highest count of overdose cases is found at zip 
				15210, which is the Mount Oliver neighborhood, at 388 cases. Other key zip codes include 15212, 15132, 15136, and 15216.

			<p>
				Going back to our very first analysis, in which we found that there was a steady increase in overdose deaths 
				over the years but with particularly large outlier cases in 2016 and 2017, we apply that interest to our 
				spatial analysis. By mapping selected years, we can see how the distribution of fatal overdoses has shifted 
				across Allegheny County over time. <br><br>
				In 2007, cases were relatively low and dispersed, with the highest ZIP reporting only 10 deaths. By 2016 and 
				2017, however, overdoses became much more concentrated in neighborhoods near the city of Pittsburgh, particularly 
				in ZIPs 15210, 15212, and 15136, each reporting close to or over 30 deaths. In 2023, while 15210 still reports the highest 
				count, other ZIPs such as 15219 and 15212 also emerge with elevated cases, suggesting that while the crisis 
				remains centered in the metropolitan area, its geographic footprint has broadened. These findings show not 
				only the intensification of the crisis during the mid-2010s but also how its spatial distribution continues 
				to evolve over time.

				<figcaption>
				Fatal overdose case aggregate by race, gender, and age group.

			</figure>
			<p>
				Next, we must also consider who is most impacted by these overdose cases. By examining 3 separate pie charts 
				of relevant demographic data (race, gender, and age), we find a series of interesting observations. To start 
				with race, white cases make up the majority of cases at 79.4% (n=5428) and black cases a significant second 
				majority of cases at 19.6% (n=1343). The remainder of races (Hispanic, Other, Asian, Mixed, Unknown, and 
				Native American) make up 1% of the cases. For sex, we find that the majority of cases are represented by the 
				male demographic (68.5%) while the female demographic makes up the minority (31.5%). For ages, we bucket the 
				ages into the following: 0-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, and 65+. Within these age buckets, we find that 3 
				age groups make up the majority and are evenly split: 25-34 bucket makes up 23.5% of cases, 35-44 makes up 
				24.5% of cases, and 45-54 makes up 24.6% of cases. <br><br>
				From these findings, we can then start to contextualize who is most at risk within Allegheny County. The 
				demographic patterns suggest that fatal overdoses are not evenly distributed across the population, but rather 
				concentrated among White and Black communities, with other races making up only a small fraction of cases. 
				The strong male majority reflects broader national trends in substance use and overdose outcomes, highlighting 
				potential gendered risk factors. Meanwhile, the concentration of cases among adults in their mid-20s through 
				mid-50s underscores that prime working-age individuals bear the heaviest burden of the crisis. <br><br>
				Together, these observations indicate that the overdose epidemic disproportionately affects men in early-to-mid 
				adulthood within White and Black populations. This demographic concentration raises important questions about 
				structural inequities, access to treatment and prevention resources, and the social and economic conditions 
				that exacerbate overdose risk.

			</figure>
			<p>
				Now that we have explored the overall summary of this demographic data, we will next explore key demographics 
				in a temporal context to better understand how certain populations are improving or worsening over time. By gaining
				 these insights, we can determine what current policies are failing, and how we can better target future interventions 
				 to help these particular groups. <br><br>
				To start, we see that for race, cases of Black overdoses are steadily increasing with the highest number of cases being 
				the most recent in 2023. Meanwhile, the cases for White overdoses rapidly peaked in 2016 and 2017, coming down to lower 
				but still increased levels in 2023. <br><br>
				We also note that for sex, the overall number of male cases has consistently been higher than female cases across all years. 
				Both groups saw their highest peaks in 2017, but while male cases dropped more sharply in 2023, female cases remain elevated 
				to similar levels from 2017, highlighting the persistence of the crisis among women. <br><br>
				Turning to age, we find that the burden of overdoses is most concentrated among individuals in the 25–54 age range. All three 
				of these core age groups (25–34, 35–44, and 45–54) spiked in 2016–2017, with some recovery afterward, but they still report 
				elevated cases in 2023 compared to earlier years. Younger individuals (0–24) show relatively few cases overall, while cases 
				among those aged 55–64 have steadily increased over time, suggesting the epidemic is also extending into older populations.<br><br>
				Taken together, these demographic trends show that while some groups experienced declines after the mid-2010s peak, many populations 
				remain at heightened risk, underscoring the need for targeted, sustained interventions tailored to both age and sex.

				Most Common Drugs in Fatal Overdose Cases (Any Involvement).

			</figure>
			<p>
				Shifting our attention from demographics to substances, we next examine which drugs are most commonly involved in fatal overdose 
				cases. Unsurprisingly, fentanyl dominates the dataset, appearing in nearly 3,900 cases, reflecting its well-documented role as 
				the primary driver of the overdose crisis. Cocaine and heroin follow as the next most common substances, with alcohol also appearing 
				frequently in combination with other drugs. Beyond these leading contributors, prescription and synthetic opioids such as alprazolam, 
				acetyl fentanyl, para-fluorofentanyl, oxycodone, methadone, and morphine appear in smaller but still significant numbers. These findings 
				highlight that while fentanyl remains the most lethal factor, polysubstance use (including combinations of opioids, stimulants, and alcohol) 
				continues to play a critical role in sustaining high fatality rates.
			</p>

				Mono vs Polysubstance Use in Fatal Overdose Cases.

			</figure>
			<p>
				Building on our analysis of drug types, we next compare single-drug overdose cases to those involving multiple substances. The results 
				reveal a striking imbalance: polysubstance overdoses account for the vast majority of cases (n=5,539), while single-drug overdoses 
				represent a much smaller portion (n=1,300). This finding emphasizes that fatal overdoses are rarely attributable to one substance 
				alone, but more often the result of dangerous drug interactions. The prominence of polysubstance cases suggests that interventions 
				must address not only the risks of individual drugs like fentanyl, but also the compounding dangers of combining opioids with stimulants, 
				alcohol, or other substances.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				Overall, in this exploratory data analysis, we pose questions in order to meaningfully model and visualize our given dataset. 
				Doing this investigation, we are able to understand the temporal and spatial context of fatal accidental overdoses. We first 
				gain insight into our data via simple univariate analyses, and find that fatal overdoses overall increased from 2007 to 2023, 
				with striking peaks in 2016 and 2017, and that overdoses follow weekly and seasonal rhythms, with cases rising toward weekends 
				and spring months. These results answer our first two questions by showing how overdoses have changed over time and how patterns 
				vary across space, as we later confirmed with maps of Allegheny County ZIP codes showing concentrations in Pittsburgh neighborhoods 
				such as 15210, 15212, and 15136.<br><br>
				We also delve deeper into exploring our dataset to address our initial questions involving demographic and polysubstance trends. 
				Demographic breakdowns reveal that overdoses disproportionately impact White and Black residents, men, and adults between 25 and 54 
				years old. Our temporal demographic analysis further highlights how Black overdoses have steadily risen into 2023, male overdoses 
				remain consistently higher than female, and older age groups (55–64) are becoming more impacted over time. In addition, examining 
				the drug dimension shows fentanyl as the most common factor, though cocaine, heroin, and alcohol also play major roles, often in combination. 
				Indeed, the overwhelming majority of cases are polysubstance, underscoring that fatal overdoses are rarely attributable to a single drug. <br><br>
				Taken together, these methods and models provide a multidimensional perspective on overdose deaths in Allegheny County. By situating temporal, 
				spatial, demographic, and substance-related insights side by side, we are able to better understand not only when and where overdoses occur, 
				but also who is most impacted and what drugs are most responsible. These findings can inform policy efforts to expand prevention, treatment, 
				and harm reduction strategies, particularly around fentanyl, polysubstance use, and the sustained risks facing working-age and Black communities.
